# SC19 Birds of a Feather
## HPC System Testing: Procedures, Acceptance, Regression Testing, and Automation
### Description

This Birds of a Feather (BOF) session will briefly highlight acceptance and
regression testing procedures at several large-scale HPC centers. The goal of
this BOF is to bring together testing efforts from multiple leadership-class
supercomputer centers and ideas from the HPC community to discuss the different
strategies used and to document lessons learned. 

BOF attendees will have the opportunity to share their experiences conducting
acceptance and regression testing at their institutions and exchange best
practices with other HPC centers.
