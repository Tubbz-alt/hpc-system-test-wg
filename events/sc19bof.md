# SC19 Birds of a Feather
## HPC System Testing: Procedures, Acceptance, Regression Testing, and Automation
### Description

This Birds of a Feather (BOF) session will briefly highlight acceptance and
regression testing procedures at several large-scale HPC centers. The goal of
this BOF is to bring together testing efforts from multiple leadership-class
supercomputer centers and ideas from the HPC community to discuss the different
strategies used and to document lessons learned. 

BOF attendees will have the opportunity to share their experiences conducting
acceptance and regression testing at their institutions and exchange best
practices with other HPC centers.

### When & Where

- *Date:* Thursday, November 21, 2019 from 12:15pm to 1:15pm.
- *Location:* Room 607, Colorado Convention Center, Denver CO, USA.

Verónica has eight years of experience in the high performance computing field and is currently working as an HPC Engineer at the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility. In addition to providing assistance to OLCF users, Verónica is part of the systems testing team, led acceptance for Summit, and leads acceptance testing for Frontier, ORNL's exascale supercomputer to be deployed in 2021. Her research interests include high performance computing, large-scale system testing, and performance evaluation and optimization of scientific applications. Verónica is a member of both IEEE and ACM and serves in the ACM SIGHPC Executive Committee.


#### Celso Mendes (NCSA)
<img src="images/CelsoMendes.jpg" width="180" align="right">
Celso L. Mendes has been working with high-performance computing for more than twenty-five years. He has been a research scientist with the Pablo research group and with the Parallel Programming Lab, both at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, conducting research on performance analysis of large parallel systems. As a senior staff member of NCSA's Blue Waters project, which he  joined since the early pre-proposal phase, he was the coordinator for acceptance testing of the sustained-petascale Blue Waters system. Celso obtained the degrees of Electronics Engineer and Master in Electronics Engineering, at ITA/Brazil, and of Ph.D. in compuer science from the University of Illinois, having developed his thesis research on performance prediction for multicomputers. He is a member of the ACM and of the Brazilian Computer Society.
